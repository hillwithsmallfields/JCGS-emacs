				    ;; SPOOLNAME can also be an IMAP maildrop.

				    ;;     An IMAP maildrop specification has the following format:

				    ;;        "imap:HOST:PORT:MAILBOX:AUTH:USER:PASSWORD"
				    ;;     or
				    ;;        "imap-ssl:HOST:PORT:MAILBOX:AUTH:USER:PASSWORD"
				    ;;     or
				    ;;        "imap-ssh:HOST:PORT:MAILBOX:AUTH:USER:PASSWORD"

				    ;;     The second form is used to speak IMAP over an SSL connection.
				    ;;     You must have the stunnel program installed and the variable
				    ;;     `vm-stunnel-program' naming it in order for IMAP over SSL to
				    ;;     work.

				    ;;     The third form is used to speak IMAP over an SSH connection.
				    ;;     You must have the ssh program installed and the variable
				    ;;     `vm-ssh-program' must name it in order for IMAP over SSH to
				    ;;     work.  SSH must be able to authenticate without a password,
				    ;;     which means you must be using .shosts authentication or
				    ;;     public key user authentication.

				    ;;     HOST is the host name of the IMAP server.

				    ;;     PORT is the TCP port number to connect to.  This should
				    ;;     normally be 143.  For IMAP over SSL, the standard port is
				    ;;     993.  There is no special port for IMAP over SSH.

				    ;;     MAILBOX is the name of the mailbox on the IMAP server.  Should
				    ;;     be "inbox", to access your default IMAP maildrop on the
				    ;;     server.

				    ;;     AUTH is the authentication method used to convince the server
				    ;;     you should have access to the maildrop.  Acceptable values
				    ;;     are "preauth", "login" and "cram-md5".  "preauth"
				    ;;     causes VM to skip the authentication stage of the protocol
				    ;;     with the assumption that the session was authenticated in some
				    ;;     external way.  "login", tells VM to use the IMAP LOGIN
				    ;;     command for authentication, which sends your username and
				    ;;     password in cleartext to the server.  "cram-md5" is a
				    ;;     challenge response system that convinces the server of your
				    ;;     identity without transmitting your password in the clear.
				    ;;     Not all servers support "cram-md5"; if you're not sure, ask
				    ;;     your mail administrator or just try it.

				    ;;     USER is the user name used with authentication methods that
				    ;;     require such an identifier.  "login" and "cram-md5"
				    ;;     use it currently.

				    ;;     PASSWORD is the secret shared by you and the server for
				    ;;     authentication purposes.  If the PASSWORD is "*", VM
				    ;;     will prompt you for the password the first time you try to
				    ;;     retrieve mail from maildrop.  If the password is valid, VM
				    ;;     will not ask you for the password again during this Emacs
				    ;;     session.
