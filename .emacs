;;; I decided it was time to re-organize, and perhaps strip down, my
;;; .emacs, and to do so using a new principle, a package
;;; configuration package that I'd started to write. My previous
;;; re-organization was to use load-directory, and I'll still use
;;; that.

;;; The triple-hash cookies are processed by
;;; `bundle-emacs-initialization' which packages up all your emacs
;;; initialization into a single file, which uses use-package to load
;;; things for which you've given use-package definitions.  This way,
;;; you can carry around a single file which will haul the rest of
;;; your setup over the net on demand.
