<h1>My emacs lisp collection</h1>

<p>This is a copy of my Emacs collection, with some HTML files added
to document it. The collection is fairly extensive (the code I wrote
myself is now 51k lines, about 1.9Mb) by now -- I started writing
elisp around 1987 as far as I can remember; I think GNUemacs was on
version 17 at the time.</p>

<p>For many years, I gave up on Usenet because of the spam, and didn't
pay much attention to any other forms of announcement; during this
period, I re-invented many Emacs wheels.  I'm now working my way
through the Emacs sources, finding out what's in there and removing my
near-duplicates (except in a few cases where I really prefer my
version) and I'm trying to keep up with what's being posted, to avoid
future duplication (again, except where I really want something a bit
different).</p>

  <dt> <a href="http://emacs-versor.sourceforge.net/">emacs-versor</a>
      on SourceForge (project page at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/emacs-versor/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/emacs-versor/</a>)
  <dd> <b>Vers</b>atile cur<b>sor</b>s, giving a wider variety of ways of moving
      around files through a narrow interface such as just the arrow
      keys, or pedals set up to imitate them.

  <dt> <a href="email/majordomo.el">email/<b>majordomo</b>.el</a> <!-- checked -->
  <dd> This package is meant for people who manage several majordomo lists.
      It composes and sends majordomo commands, parses the replies, and
      maintains a cache of the membership of each list. It could do
      with a bit more work on it.

  <dt> <a href="basics/use-package.el">basics/<b>use-package</b>.el</a>
  <dd> Download and configure packages on demand.  Like a remote
       version of <code>autoload</code> but with opportunities to set
       variables, hooks etc at the same time as specifying where to get the
       package from.  Particularly handy if you're a flashcard based nomad
       and don't want to have to take all the big packages around with you.
       
       <!--
  <dt> <a href="basics/load-directory.el">basics/<b>load-directory</b>.el</a> <!-- checked -->
  <dd> Loads all the el / elc files in a directory.

  <dt> <a href="editing/diary-mode.el">editing/<b>diary-mode</b>.el</a>	<!-- checked -->
  <dd> Major mode for editing diary files. Colours days of the week differently.
-->
  <dt> <a href="editing/generic-text.el">editing/<b>generic-text</b>.el</a> <!-- checked -->
      and friends
  <dd> Mode-sensitive insertion of markup, using the same commands for
      TeX, LaTeX, HTML, *roff, and plain text. (Not all implemented
      yet -- *roff contributions would be welcome.) They provide similar
      facilities to <a
      href="http://www.santafe.edu/~nelson/tools/">html-helper-mode</a>
      but consistently across several markup-language modes.

  <dt> <a href="editing/replace-regexp-list.el">editing/<b>replace-regexp-list</b>.el</a> <!-- checked -->
      and <a href="editing/edit-tree.el">editing/<b>edit-tree</b>.el</a> <!-- checked -->
  <dd> Apply lots of edits systematically. These two are most useful
      used together. I don't need them often, but when I do need them,
      I really need them!

  <dt> <a href="misc/banner.el">misc/<b>banner</b>.el</a> <!-- checked -->
  <dd> Giant writing.

  <dt> <a href="http://mulvoc.sourceforge.net/"><b>mulvoc</b> (on Sourceforge) </a> <!-- checked -->
  <dd> <b>MU</b>lti-<b>L</b>ingual <b>VOC</b>abularies, read in from CSV (Comma-Separated
      Value) files (a spreadsheet interchange format). I have great
      expectations of this (there's early-stage enthusiasm for you),
      but it is quite new. It now has quite a few source files, and
      has now become a SourceForge project so people can share vocabularies there.

  <dt> <a href="natural-language/localized-source.el">natural-language/<b>localized-source.el</b></a> <!-- checked -->
  <dd> Show localization for source files, e.g. translations of
      comments and perhaps names. Intended for (typically open-source)
      developers in countries where knowledge of English is not
      typically good; particularly where there may be large
      organizations who could have translators translating the
      comments on open-source code that their programmers then work
      on.

  <dt> <a href="http://sidebrain.sourceforge.net/">sidebrain</a>
      (project page at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sidebrain/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/sidebrain/</a>)
  <dd> A working memory tool for programmers: it maintains a stack of
      your current tasks, and a queue or pool of pending tasks, and a
      set of observations, to help to remind you what you're
      doing. This is a fairly new project; for what I can tell so far,
      it helps me to keep focused on what I'm doing. 

  <dt> <a href="my-extensions-to-packages/voice/embedded-commands.el">my-extensions-to-packages/voice/<b>embedded-commands.el</b></a>
  <dd> Allow commands embedded in dictated text, for voice
      recognition. Needs my improved version of <a href="../open-projects/emacs-vr-mode/vrmode/vr.el">vr.el</a>.

<h2>Directory location and structure</h2>

<p>Because I ship my emacs setup around between various machines, it
all uses an environment <code>$SYNCED</code> (which on a Unix-style
system I set to <code>$HOME/common</code>) as its idea of where
everything lives. This directory (the one in which this page resides)
expects to be found at <code>$SYNCED/emacs</code>. It also expects
some companion directories, <code>$SYNCED/open-projects</code>
containing packages from sourceforge etc (including one which I
manage), and <code>$SYNCED/emacs-library</code> containing packages I
have downloaded from elsewhere. (By the way, I can definitely
recommend this way of working: <code>$SYNCED</code> contains also my
research papers, personal web site etc -- all the things I ship around
all my machines -- and all fits handily onto a USB key. That way, I
can keep my machines at home isolated from the Internet, and
concentrate on getting things done there, without email interruptions
and web distractions.)</p>

<p><code>$SYNCED</code> points to the things I wrote myself. All the
things that I gathered from the net, rather than wrote myself, are
pointed to by <code>$GATHERED</code>.</p>

<p>Code related to this way of working is in <a
href="file-handling/filenames-in-env.el">file-handling/filenames-in-env.el</a>
and in <a
href="file-handling/common-directory.el">file-handling/common-directory.el</a>.</p>

<h2>My emacs startup structure</h2>

<p>My <code>.emacs</code> sets up some environment variables
representing where the rest of my emacs stuff is, then loads the
contents of <code><a href="config/index.html">config</a></code>, which
mostly uses <code><a
href="basics/use-package.el">use-package</a></code> to find and
configure packages.</p>

<h2>My emacs directory contents</h2>

<p>Some of this is acquired long ago from others, but I wrote most of
it myself. (Stuff I downloaded from others goes in <a
href="#emacs-library">a separate directory</a>.) I'm trying to update
all files in it that I remember I wrote myself, to identify them as
such. I also mean to GPL it all, although some files may yet have
escaped getting a GPL notice in them.</p>

      things to be conditional on, for example, whether this is the
      machine on which I habitually read my mail. For flexibility, it
      has a function named after the short name of each machine for

	<dt> <a href="unplugged/index.html">unplugged</a>
	<dd> I find I'm much more productive off-line, shuttling my files
	    around on USB mass storage devices. I'm not the only one who
	    finds this, I know, and with the information (and
	    distraction) overload that can so easily happen nowadays,
	    and with the risk of large companies attempting to
	    interfere with FLOSS development, I think it could be an
	    important part of the way forward for software
	    developments, so I'm starting a line of
	    research into how to do ``unplugged'' distributed development.

  <dt> <a href="ringing/index.html">ringing</a>
  <dd> Emacs software for

      first few months of making my collection public.

<h2>Compatibility etc</h2>

<p>I've not yet tried to unpick everything so each piece can be used
by itself in a vanilla emacs. I might get round to some of that
sometime (I hope I will, but then I hope all kinds of things).</p>

<p>I've not tried any of these with Xemacs. I'd be interested to hear
if you use any of my files successfully with it, and will mark them as
such if you do, but I'm not planning to get into that myself for the
time being.</p>
