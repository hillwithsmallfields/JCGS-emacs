;;; Commentary:

;; I copy files between my linux phone and desktop / laptop computers,
;; while leaving an Emacs session running.  This file re-loads buffers
;; visiting files that this process is likely to change.  It can be
;; run on my phone's emacs or my desktop / laptop's emacs.

;; TODO: If the N900's DBUS will tell me the phone's MMC is dismounted as a USB gadget, make that trigger a post-sync-catchup
